Need of Resume Screening
For each recruitment, companies take out online ads, referrals and go through them manually.

Companies often submit thousands of resumes for every posting.

When companies collect resumes through online advertisements, they categorize those resumes according to their requirements.

After collecting resumes, companies close advertisements and online applying portals. Then they send the collected resumes to the Hiring Team(s).

IT departments are short of growing markets. In a typical service organization, professionals with a variety of technical skills and business domain expertise are hired and assigned to projects to resolve customer issues. This task of selecting the best talent among many others is known as Resume Screening.

Typically, large companies do not have enough time to open each CV, so they use machine learning algorithms for the Resume Screening task.
